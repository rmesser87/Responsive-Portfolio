            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img src="./assets/images/placeholderimage.png" alt="Ross's Photo" width="200" />
            <p>I was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. My passion in wildlife and the environment led me to pursue a B.S. in Conservation
                Biology from LSU. Following graduation, I took several temporary Biologist positions in Louisiana, Tennessee,
                Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin, North Dakota, and Alaska. Those years as a temporary biologist, although fulfilling,
                made it clear to me that to advance my career I needed to advance my education.</p>
            <p>I pursued a master's degree in Geography- Applied GIS from Sam Houston State University. Following graduation
                from SHSU, I worked as a Fur Biologist for the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries. Wanting more
                financial stability I moved to Houston to work for an environmental consulting company. Not long after working
                at the consulting company, I was tasked with creating a GIS department. Now here I am again, wanted to advance
                my education and career as a developer.</p>
